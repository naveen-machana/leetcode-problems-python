Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a good subarray or false otherwise.
A good subarray is a subarray where:
its length is at least two, and
the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of k.
Note that:
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.
Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.

Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.
42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.
