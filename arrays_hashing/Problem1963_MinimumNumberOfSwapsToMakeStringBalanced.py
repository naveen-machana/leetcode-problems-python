https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/
You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2
 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".

class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, s: str) -> int:
        stackSize = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '[':
                stackSize += 1
            elif stackSize > 0:
                stackSize -= 1
        return (stackSize + 1) // 2
